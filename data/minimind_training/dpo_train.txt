Question: What is deep learning?|||Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.|||Deep learning uses neural networks.
Question: Explain backpropagation|||Backpropagation is the algorithm that computes gradients by applying the chain rule backwards through the network, enabling efficient weight updates.|||It updates weights.
Question: What is overfitting?|||Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well including noise, resulting in poor generalization. Solutions include regularization and dropout.|||Model memorizes data.
Question: Define gradient descent|||Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes loss by computing gradients and updating parameters in the opposite direction.|||It minimizes loss.
Question: What are transformers?|||Transformers are neural network architectures that use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies.|||Attention based models.

Instruction: Read a file|||with open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: content = f.read()|||open and read
Question: What is attention mechanism?|||Attention allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input by computing weighted sums based on query-key similarity.|||It helps models focus.
Question: Explain BERT|||BERT uses bidirectional transformers with masked language modeling pre-training to capture deep contextual representations.|||BERT is a language model.
Question: What is GPT?|||GPT is an autoregressive transformer language model that predicts next tokens based on previous context, excelling at text generation.|||GPT generates text.
Question: Define transfer learning|||Transfer learning reuses knowledge from pre-trained models on large datasets to improve performance on related tasks with limited data.|||Use old models.
Question: What is fine-tuning?|||Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained model parameters to specific downstream tasks through continued training with lower learning rates.|||Train model more.

Task: Write documentation|||Include API reference, usage examples, installation guide, architecture overview, and maintain changelog with version history.|||Write docs.
Task: Handle errors|||Implement proper exception handling, provide informative error messages, log errors with context, and fail gracefully.|||Catch errors.
Question: How to prevent overfitting?|||Use regularization techniques like L1/L2, dropout layers, early stopping, data augmentation, and cross-validation.|||Use less data.
Question: Explain cross-validation|||Cross-validation partitions data into k folds, trains on k-1 folds, validates on remaining fold, and averages results.|||Split data multiple times.
Question: What is regularization?|||Regularization adds penalty terms to loss function to constrain model complexity, preventing overfitting.|||Makes model simpler.
Question: Define learning rate|||Learning rate controls step size in gradient descent, balancing convergence speed against stability.|||How fast model learns.
