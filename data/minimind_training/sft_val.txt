Question: What is deep learning? Answer: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
Question: Explain backpropagation Answer: Backpropagation is an algorithm that computes gradients to update neural network weights
Question: What is overfitting? Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data instead of learning general patterns
Question: Define gradient descent Answer: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes loss by updating parameters
Question: What are transformers? Answer: Transformers are neural network architectures using self-attention mechanisms
Question: Explain attention mechanism Answer: Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of input when processing information
Question: What is fine-tuning? Answer: Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks with additional training
Question: Define reinforcement learning Answer: Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and penalties for actions
Question: What is tokenization? Answer: Tokenization splits text into smaller units like words or subwords for processing
Question: Explain embedding layers Answer: Embedding layers convert discrete tokens into continuous vector representations
