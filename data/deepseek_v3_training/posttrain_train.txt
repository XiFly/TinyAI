[REASONING] Question: What is Mixture of Experts? Answer: Mixture of Experts is an architecture that uses multiple specialized expert networks with a gating mechanism to route inputs efficiently
[REASONING] Question: How does MoE routing work? Answer: MoE routing uses a gating network to compute scores for each expert and selects the top K experts to process each input token
[REASONING] Question: Why is load balancing important in MoE? Answer: Load balancing ensures all experts are utilized evenly preventing some experts from being overused while others remain idle
[REASONING] Question: What is sparse activation? Answer: Sparse activation means only a subset of model parameters are active for each input reducing computational cost significantly
[MATH] Question: If MoE has 8 experts and uses top 2 routing what is the activation ratio? Answer: The activation ratio is 2 divided by 8 which equals 0.25 or 25 percent
[GENERAL] Question: What is DeepSeek V3? Answer: DeepSeek V3 is an advanced language model combining MoE architecture with task aware routing for efficient and high quality text generation
[REASONING] Question: How does task aware architecture help? Answer: Task aware architecture adapts model behavior based on task type routing inputs to experts specialized for reasoning coding math or other domains
[CODING] Question: What languages does DeepSeek support? Answer: DeepSeek supports ten programming languages including Python Java C plus plus JavaScript Go Rust TypeScript Ruby PHP and Swift
[CODING] Question: How is code quality evaluated? Answer: Code quality is evaluated on four dimensions correctness readability efficiency and adherence to style guidelines
[GENERAL] Question: What are DeepSeek advantages? Answer: DeepSeek advantages include efficient sparse computation task adaptive routing strong code generation and fast inference speed
[CODING] Question: What is Python used for? Answer: Python is used for machine learning data science web development automation scientific computing and general purpose programming
[CODING] Question: Explain object oriented programming. Answer: Object oriented programming organizes code into objects that combine data and methods providing encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism
[CODING] Question: What is algorithm complexity? Answer: Algorithm complexity measures computational resources required typically expressed as time complexity and space complexity using big O notation
[CODING] Question: Why is code readability important? Answer: Code readability makes programs easier to understand maintain debug and extend by other developers or future self
[CODING] Question: What are design patterns? Answer: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems providing tested templates for solving recurring challenges
[REASONING] Question: What is self attention? Answer: Self attention computes relationships between all positions in a sequence allowing each position to attend to all other positions in parallel
[REASONING] Question: Why use multi head attention? Answer: Multi head attention allows the model to attend to different representation subspaces simultaneously capturing diverse types of relationships
[GENERAL] Question: What is positional encoding? Answer: Positional encoding injects information about token positions into embeddings since transformers have no inherent notion of sequence order
[REASONING] Question: How does attention scaling work? Answer: Attention scores are scaled by the square root of dimension to prevent extremely small gradients when dot products grow large
[GENERAL] Question: What is the transformer advantage? Answer: Transformers enable parallel processing of sequences eliminate vanishing gradients and capture long range dependencies effectively
[REASONING] Question: What is backpropagation? Answer: Backpropagation computes gradients of loss with respect to parameters by applying chain rule backwards through the computational graph
[MATH] Question: How does gradient descent work? Answer: Gradient descent updates parameters by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient scaled by learning rate to minimize loss
[REASONING] Question: Why use activation functions? Answer: Activation functions introduce non linearity enabling neural networks to learn complex patterns beyond linear relationships
[GENERAL] Question: What is overfitting? Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well including noise and fails to generalize to new unseen data
[REASONING] Question: How does dropout prevent overfitting? Answer: Dropout randomly disables neurons during training forcing the network to learn robust features that do not rely on specific neurons
